    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">Bacalhau directly translated means cod fish, however it refers to cod that's been dried and salted. It's extremely popular and directly translates to cod fish with cream. 
        Because bacalhau is dried and salted, it needs to be soaked before it is cooked. Smaller pieces may take around 4-6 hours but large pieces need to be soaked for much longer. This rehydrates the fish and removes lots of the salt content. 
        I personally <em>love</em> this and will always get mumsy to make me some.</p>
